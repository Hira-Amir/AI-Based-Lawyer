# AI-Based-Lawyer
## Week 01 - Engineering ðŸš€

### Problem Statement:
Hiring a lawyer can get pretty expensive in Pakistan. Two non-technical investors thought of an idea to create an AI-based lawyer that can process textual queries and answer them accordingly with citations to the PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) and Constitution. This is especially useful for people living in remote areas and even urban women looking to get a consultation privately. Luckily, you run a software development business and will be providing them services.
